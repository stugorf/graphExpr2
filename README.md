# Graph Database with DevSpaces

In this repository, I am going to use a graph database with DevSpaces.

# How to use the web interface

1. Make note of the URL of your DevSpace
2. Add `7867-` to the URL
3. Go to Neo4j web console, connect to `neo4j+s://7687-{SERVER_NAME}:443`

For example, if your DevSpaces was:

```
https://amber-bear-b7rpq669.ws.eyk.devspaces.com/
```

Then when you get to the Neo4j web console, the address is:

```
neo4j+s://7867-amber-bear-b7rpq669.ws.eyk.devspaces.com:443/
```

Login with username: `neo4j`, password: `neo4j`. You will have to change your password upon first login.
